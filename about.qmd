This project came about due to [my](https://github.com/uravat/) interest in data science and food and health. I'm curious to figure out **How  dietary patterns influence health and disease?** 

To begin I am looking at what people eat. Curious? Check [here](https://github.com/uravat/food-and-health)  to see my explorations into **What can dietary patterns tells us?**  Email me if interested uma.ravat.ucsb@gmail.com

I have created this project website as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).

Using data from the NNMB (National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau) survey (2009–2012) on rural nutritional status, we examine the relationship between food composition and BMI (Body Mass Index). Since BMI is a known marker for lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, we explores how dietary patterns relate to these health risks.

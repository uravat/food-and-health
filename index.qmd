How do dietary patterns influence health and disease? Using data from NNMB survey collected from 2009 - 2012 for nutritional status of rural population,  we seek to examine the relationship between diet and prelevance of lifestyle diseases among adults. Diet patterns impact health and can pay a major role in life-style diseases like blood-pressue, diabetes and obesity.

I’m curious to figure out How dietary patterns influence health and disease?\nTo begin I am looking at what people eat. Curious? Check here to see my explorations into What can dietary patterns tells us?\nI have created this project website as a part of Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp."

    "text": "What can dietary patterns tells us? \nUsing data from the NNMB (National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau) survey (2009–2012) on rural nutritional status, we examine the relationship between food composition(what people eat) and BMI (Body Mass Index). Since BMI is a known marker for lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, this analysis explores how dietary patterns relate to these health risks. Higher BMI diets tend to have lower carbohydrates and higher fats, highlighting diet’s role in lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity."
